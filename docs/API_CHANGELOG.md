# API Changelog

## [0.4.0] — 2026-02-15

### New Sources (5)

Added 5 new job source integrations (Tier 3 — heavy anti-bot / enterprise ATS):

**ATS (3):**
- **Oracle Taleo** — REST API (JSON), `{company}:{careerSection}` slug format
- **iCIMS** *(WIP)* — JSON gateway + Playwright fallback with stealth mode
- **SAP SuccessFactors** *(WIP)* — OData API + HTML fallback, `{instance}:{companyId}` slug format

**Job Boards (2):**
- **Monster** *(WIP)* — `appsapi.monster.io` JSON API + Playwright stealth fallback (DataDome protected)
- **CareerBuilder** *(WIP)* — Cheerio + Playwright stealth fallback (Cloudflare protected)

Total sources expanded from 46 to 51.

### New `siteType` Values

- `taleo`, `icims`, `successfactors` — ATS sources (require `companySlug` parameter)
- `monster`, `careerbuilder` — search-based job boards (included in default searches)

### BrowserPool Stealth Mode

New `stealth: true` option for `BrowserPool.getPage()` enables anti-bot evasion:
- User-Agent rotation (6 recent Chrome UAs across Mac/Win/Linux)
- Viewport randomization (5 common resolutions)
- JavaScript injection to mask `navigator.webdriver`, fake `window.chrome.runtime`, override `navigator.plugins`, patch canvas fingerprinting, and spoof WebGL renderer info

### Proxy Support

All 5 sources wire proxies through:
- HTTP sources: via `createHttpClient({ proxies })`
- Playwright sources: via `BrowserPool.getPage({ proxy, stealth: true })`

### WIP Sources Note

4 of 5 sources are marked WIP — Monster and CareerBuilder will likely need residential proxies for reliable operation. iCIMS layouts vary per company deployment. SuccessFactors OData access varies per company configuration.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-02-15

### New Sources (7)

Added 7 new job source integrations (Tier 2 — HTML scraping / Playwright):

- **BambooHR** — Public JSON API, `{companySlug}.bamboohr.com/careers/list`
- **Personio** — Public XML feed, `{companySlug}.jobs.personio.de/xml`
- **JazzHR** *(WIP)* — HTML scraping, `{companySlug}.applytojob.com/apply/jobs/`

**Job Boards (4):**
- **Dice** *(WIP)* — Cheerio + Playwright fallback, US tech jobs
- **SimplyHired** *(WIP)* — Cheerio + Playwright fallback, global
- **Wellfound** *(WIP)* — Playwright SPA (`__NEXT_DATA__` extraction), startup jobs
- **StepStone** *(WIP)* — Playwright SPA, Germany (`.de`) initially

Total sources expanded from 39 to 46.

### New `siteType` Values

- `bamboohr`, `personio`, `jazzhr` — ATS sources (require `companySlug` parameter)
- `dice`, `simplyhired`, `wellfound`, `stepstone` — search-based job boards (included in default searches)

### Proxy Support

All 7 sources wire proxies through:
- HTTP sources: via `createHttpClient({ proxies })`
- Playwright sources: via `BrowserPool.getPage({ proxy })`

### WIP Sources Note

5 of 7 sources are marked WIP — code is shipped but HTML selectors need validation against live sites. These sources will gracefully return empty results if selectors are outdated.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-02-14

### New Sources (5)

Added 5 new job source integrations (Tier 1.5 — free API key required):

- **USAJobs** — US government job board (`USAJOBS_API_KEY` + `USAJOBS_EMAIL`)
- **Adzuna** — Multi-country aggregator, 12+ countries (`ADZUNA_APP_ID` + `ADZUNA_APP_KEY`)
- **Reed** — UK-focused job board (`REED_API_KEY`)
- **Jooble** — 70+ country aggregator (`JOOBLE_API_KEY`)
- **CareerJet** — 80+ country aggregator (`CAREERJET_AFFID`)

Total sources expanded from 34 to 39.

### New `siteType` Values

- `usajobs`, `adzuna`, `reed`, `jooble`, `careerjet` — search-based job sources (included in default searches when API keys are configured)

### New Input Field

- `clientIp` — Optional client IP address for sources that require it (e.g. CareerJet). Also useful for residential proxy rotation strategies. Combined with the existing `proxies` array for multi-IP support.

### Per-Request Auth Override

All API-key sources now support per-request credential override via `auth` in the request body, following the existing Upwork pattern. This allows clients to use their own API keys instead of (or in addition to) server-side environment variables.

New `auth` sub-objects: `auth.usajobs`, `auth.adzuna`, `auth.reed`, `auth.jooble`, `auth.careerjet`, `auth.exa`

Each credential field resolves independently — callers can override individual fields while keeping others from env vars (e.g. override `auth.usajobs.apiKey` but keep `email` from `USAJOBS_EMAIL`).

### New `siteType` Values

- `remoteok`, `remotive`, `jobicy`, `himalayas`, `arbeitnow`, `weworkremotely` — search-based job boards (included in default searches)
