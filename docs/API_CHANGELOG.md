# API Changelog

## [0.2.0] — 2026-02-14

### New Sources (5)

Added 5 new job source integrations (Tier 1.5 — free API key required):

- **USAJobs** — US government job board (`USAJOBS_API_KEY` + `USAJOBS_EMAIL`)
- **Adzuna** — Multi-country aggregator, 12+ countries (`ADZUNA_APP_ID` + `ADZUNA_APP_KEY`)
- **Reed** — UK-focused job board (`REED_API_KEY`)
- **Jooble** — 70+ country aggregator (`JOOBLE_API_KEY`)
- **CareerJet** — 80+ country aggregator (`CAREERJET_AFFID`)

Total sources expanded from 34 to 39.

### New `siteType` Values

- `usajobs`, `adzuna`, `reed`, `jooble`, `careerjet` — search-based job sources (included in default searches when API keys are configured)

### New Input Field

- `clientIp` — Optional client IP address for sources that require it (e.g. CareerJet). Also useful for residential proxy rotation strategies. Combined with the existing `proxies` array for multi-IP support.

### Per-Request Auth Override

All API-key sources now support per-request credential override via `auth` in the request body, following the existing Upwork pattern. This allows clients to use their own API keys instead of (or in addition to) server-side environment variables.

New `auth` sub-objects: `auth.usajobs`, `auth.adzuna`, `auth.reed`, `auth.jooble`, `auth.careerjet`, `auth.exa`

Each credential field resolves independently — callers can override individual fields while keeping others from env vars (e.g. override `auth.usajobs.apiKey` but keep `email` from `USAJOBS_EMAIL`).
